        <h2 class="section__description">About The Program</h2>
        <p><b>ZeroApnea.org</b> is a community-led volunteer initiative that connects people who have been diagnosed with sleep apnea but cannot afford therapy with donated CPAP equipment.</p>
		<p>Many individuals across Ontario live with sleep apnea but face barriers such as limited insurance coverage, high deductibles, or financial hardship. At the same time, thousands of current CPAP users upgrade or no longer need their older machines and would gladly share them if they knew where to send them.</p>
		<p>The ZeroApnea.org Sleep Apnea Refurbishment Program was created to bring these two groups together. Our volunteers collect gently used CPAP and BiPAP machines, clean and inspect them, and prepare them for redistribution to patients who have a valid prescription but cannot afford their own device.</p>
        <h2 class="section__description">Why This Matters</h2>
        <ul>
		<li>Sleep apnea affects roughly three percent of Ontario adults, with many more living undiagnosed or untreated.</li>
		<li>Untreated sleep apnea increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and depression.</li>
		<li>The cost of therapy, often between $1,500 and $6,000, places it out of reach for many households.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>By connecting donors and patients, ZeroApnea.org helps ensure that effective sleep therapy reaches those who need it most while keeping reusable medical equipment out of landfills. Every donated machine represents a second chance for better sleep, better health, and a better life.</p>

        <p>ZeroApnea.org is a volunteer-run, community-based initiative currently in the process of formal registration.</p>
		<p>All donations are received and managed by its coordinators solely for humanitarian purposes. We do not sell, rent, or profit from donated equipment, and we operate independently from manufacturers, retailers, or government agencies.</p>

            While you may be able to find people selling on Craigslist, facebook

            Though people who cannot afford their device but need a CPAP machine
            will look on Craigslist, facebook or Kijiji, the machines sold there
            may or may not work properly, the seller may not post accurate
            listing information, and the machine may not be set to the correct
            mode or pressure.

            You can only sell CPAP devices if you have permission from the

          <p>
            On Ebay, you can only sell CPAP devices if you have permission from
            the appropriate regulatory authorities to do so, which would not
            apply to most people selling a used device. If you are looking to
            sell a used CPAP, you will need to go through an authorized reseller
            who will sell to individuals with prescriptions, rather than trying
            to sell on the open marketplace.

          Donating your CPAP machine will get it out of your home, give you a
          tax benefit, and allow you to help someone who needs sleep apnea
          treatment but may not be able to afford it. Here's how and why you may
          wish to donate your used CPAP machine.
