        <h2 class="section__description">For Donors</h2>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Q: What types of CPAP equipment can I donate?</h2>
			
			<p>We gratefully accept most CPAP and BiPAP machines, regardless of age or model. Even if your machine is older, we may be able to refurbish or use its parts to repair other units.</p>
			<p>We also welcome both opened and unopened accessories such as masks, tubing, and humidifier chambers.</p>
			<p>Please note that filters must be <strong>new and unopened</strong> to ensure safety and hygiene.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Are there any items you do not accept?</h2>
			
			<p>Yes, a few limitations help us keep donations safe and effective:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We cannot accept completely non-functional machines that have no reusable components.</li>
				<li>Devices from recalled models (for example, certain Philips Respironics units) are accepted <strong>for parts only</strong>.</li>
				<li>We cannot accept accessories that are heavily worn or unsanitary.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you’re unsure about an item, please contact us before donating.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Q: How can I donate my equipment?</h2>

			<p>If you live in the <strong>Ottawa–Gatineau</strong> region, you can schedule a <strong>free pickup</strong> through our online form.</p>
			<p>For donors outside this area, we provide <strong>prepaid Canada Post shipping labels or QR codes</strong> so you can send your donation quickly, safely, and at no cost to you.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Is my donation tax-deductible?</h2>
		
			<p>ZeroApnea.org is a community-led volunteer initiative that operates on a non-profit basis and is working toward formal registration as a non-profit organization.</p>
			<p>We are not yet a registered charity and therefore cannot issue tax-deductible receipts.</p>
			<p>Your equipment donation still carries immense value—it helps someone breathe and sleep better, keeps usable devices out of landfills, and strengthens a caring community of support.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: How is donated equipment prepared for new users?</h2>

			<p>Each donated device is <strong>cleaned, inspected, and function-tested</strong> by trained volunteers following manufacturer guidelines and best-practice hygiene procedures.</p>
			<p>While we take every reasonable precaution to ensure quality, refurbished equipment is provided <strong>"as-is"</strong> and should only be used under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider.</p>
		</div>

	<div>
		<h2 class="section__description">For Recipients</h2>

		<div>
			<h2>Q: Who is eligible to receive donated CPAP equipment?</h2>

			<p>Our program supports individuals who have been <strong>medically diagnosed with sleep apnea</strong> but cannot afford CPAP therapy.</p>
			<p>Priority is given to those without insurance coverage or experiencing significant financial hardship.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Is there a cost to receive equipment?</h2>

			<p>No. All machines and essential accessories are provided <strong>free of charge</strong>, including shipping when needed.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: How do I apply to receive equipment?</h2>

			<p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@zeroapnea.org">info@zeroapnea.org</a> describing your situation and needs.
			<p>We will send you a short application package—be sure to include a <strong>valid medical prescription</strong> for CPAP therapy.</p>
			<p>Once your completed application is received, our volunteers will review it and contact you about next steps.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: What equipment will I receive?</h2>

			<p>Eligible recipients typically receive a refurbished CPAP or BiPAP machine, along with essential accessories such as a mask, tubing, filters, and a humidifier chamber.</p>
			<p>The specific brand or model depends on available inventory, but we always ensure that each recipient receives a reliable, medically appropriate device.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Can I request a specific brand or model?</h2>

			<p>We try our best to accommodate preferences, but our inventory depends entirely on community donations.</p>
			<p>We match each recipient with the most suitable device available for their therapy requirements.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="section__description">General Information</h2>

		<div>
			<h2>Q: How else can I support ZeroApnea.org besides donating equipment?</h2>

			<p>We deeply appreciate your willingness to help.</p>
			<p>Although we cannot yet accept financial contributions, there are still many powerful ways to support our mission:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Spread the word</strong>: Tell friends, family, healthcare professionals, and CPAP retailers about ZeroApnea.org.</li>
			<li><strong>Refer donors</strong>: Encourage people to pass on gently used equipment instead of discarding it.</li>
			<li><strong>Cover your own shipping (optional)</strong>: If you choose to pay the postage directly when sending your donation, you help us extend free-shipping support to others.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a volunteer-run initiative like ours, every referral, every conversation, and every shared link makes a real difference.</p>
			<p>Thank you for being part of this community of care.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: How do you ensure the safety and reliability of donated equipment?</h2>

			<p>Safety is our highest priority. Each machine goes through a <strong>structured intake, cleaning, and testing process</strong> before being reassigned.</p>
			<p>Devices are refurbished only to the extent needed to ensure basic functionality and hygiene, and they are distributed <strong>as-is</strong> with the understanding that users must follow their doctor’s guidance.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Can I share my experience with ZeroApnea.org?</h2>

			<p>Absolutely! We value testimonials and feedback from both donors and recipients.</p>
			<p>Your stories inspire others to contribute and help us strengthen our outreach.</p>
			<p>Please contact us through our website or email us directly at <a href="mailto:info@zeroapnea.org">info@zeroapnea.org</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Q: Who oversees ZeroApnea.org?</h2>

			<p>ZeroApnea.org is a <strong>community-led volunteer initiative currently in the process of formal registration.</strong></p>
			<p>All donations are received and managed by its coordinators <strong>solely for humanitarian purposes.</strong></p>
			<p>We do not sell or profit from donated equipment, and all activities are conducted transparently and in good faith to support individuals in need.</p>
