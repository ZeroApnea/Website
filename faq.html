		<div>
			<h3>Q: What types of CPAP equipment can I donate?</h3>
			
			We gratefully accept CPAP and BiPAP machines of all ages and conditions. Even if your machine is older, we can refurbish or use its parts to repair other devices. Additionally, we accept both opened and unopened accessories such as masks, tubing, and humidifier chambers. Filters, however, should always be new and unopened to ensure safety and hygiene.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: Are there any items you do not accept?</h3>

			Yes, we do have some limitations:
			<ul>
				<li>We generally do not accept completely non-functional machines that cannot provide useful spare parts. However, working components such as power cords, tubing, and water chambers from these devices are welcome.</li>
				<li>Devices from recalled models (e.g., certain Philips Respironics units) are accepted strictly for parts.</li>
				<li>We do not accept used accessories that are worn beyond refurbishing or sanitizing.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: How can I donate my equipment?</h3>

			If you're located in the Ottawa-Gatineau region, you can conveniently schedule a free pickup through our online form. For donors outside this area, we offer prepaid shipping labels or QR codes to facilitate free, easy, and secure shipping directly to us.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: Is my donation tax-deductible?</h3>
			
			Currently, ZeroApnea.org operates as a registered non-profit organization and is actively working toward achieving official charitable status. While we’re not yet able to issue tax-deductible receipts, we remain fully committed to transparency and accountability.
			<br><br>
			It’s important to note that tax-deductible receipts for medical equipment, such as CPAP machines are generally difficult to approve under current CRA rules, even for fully registered charities. This is partly because most CPAP devices are considered personal-use medical equipment and are not eligible for returns by retailers or resale.
			<br><br>
			That said, your donation still carries enormous value. It helps someone breathe and sleep better, often for the first time in years. And we make every effort to recognize your generosity in meaningful ways while working to expand our capacity for the future.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: How is donated equipment prepared for new users?</h3>

			Each donated device undergoes a thorough inspection, cleaning, and sanitization process. Our dedicated team of volunteer biomedical professionals meticulously refurbishes each unit, ensuring that all equipment meets stringent performance and safety standards before redistribution. This rigorous preparation is essential for ensuring every machine delivered provides reliable and safe sleep therapy.
		</div>

		<h2 class="section__description">For Recipients</h2>

		<div>
			<h3>Q: Who is eligible to receive donated CPAP equipment?</h3>

				Our program primarily supports individuals who have been medically diagnosed with sleep apnea but are unable to afford CPAP therapy. Priority is given to those without insurance coverage, facing financial hardship, or with very limited financial resources.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: Is there a cost to receive equipment?</h3>

			No. ZeroApnea.org provides CPAP machines and all necessary accessories completely free of charge to eligible recipients, including covering any associated shipping costs.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: How do I apply to receive equipment?</h3>

			To apply, please email us describing your situation and your specific needs. We will then send you an application package. Please ensure you have a valid medical prescription for CPAP therapy. Once your completed application is received, our team will carefully review it and promptly contact you regarding next steps.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: What equipment will I receive?</h3>

			Eligible recipients typically receive a refurbished CPAP or BiPAP machine along with essential accessories such as a mask, tubing, filters, and humidifier chambers. The specific models provided depend on current availability and donated inventory.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: Can I request a specific brand or model?</h3>

			We always strive to accommodate individual preferences; however, our inventory is dependent on donations. While we cannot guarantee specific brands or models, we promise to match you with a suitable, reliable device based on your medical needs and our available inventory.
		</div>
	</div>

		<h2 class="section__description">General Information</h2>

		<div>
			<h3>Q: How else can I support ZeroApnea.org besides donating equipment?</h3>

			We deeply appreciate your desire to help. While we are not yet able to accept financial contributions until we receive our official charitable status, there are still powerful ways you can support our mission.
			<br><br>
			One of the most impactful things you can do is to spread the word. Tell friends, family, health professionals, or even your local CPAP retailer about ZeroApnea.org. Many patients try to return machines they no longer need—encouraging retailers to refer them to us could give those devices a second life and bring relief to someone in desperate need.
			<br><br>
			Another meaningful way to contribute is by covering the cost of shipping for your donation (if you’re able to). While we proudly offer free shipping options to keep giving accessible to all, donors who choose to cover their shipping allow us to stretch our resources further and serve even more people.
			<br><br>
			In a volunteer-run organization like ours, every conversation, every referral, every shared link makes a difference. You are our voice, our community, and our movement. Thank you for standing with us.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: How do you ensure the safety and reliability of donated equipment?</h3>

			Safety is our highest priority. Each CPAP and BiPAP machine undergo meticulous inspection, comprehensive cleaning, refurbishment, and rigorous testing conducted by trained and qualified volunteer professionals. We adhere strictly to industry standards and guidelines to ensure every device we distribute is safe, reliable, and effective for patient use.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Q: Can I share my experience with ZeroApnea.org?</h3>

			Absolutely! We deeply value testimonials and feedback from our generous donors and recipients. Your experiences and insights are critical in inspiring others to support our mission. Please use our contact form to share your comments and feedback and help us continue making a difference in the community.
		</div>

		If you have further questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us through our website or directly via email. Your support is integral to our continued success in providing accessible CPAP therapy to those who need it most.
