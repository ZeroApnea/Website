		<p>
		<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The information below is provided for general educational purposes only. It is not intended to replace professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider regarding diagnosis or treatment of sleep apnea.
		</p>

        <h2 class="section__description">What is Sleep Apnea?</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. These pauses in breathing can last 10–30 seconds and occur many times per night, disrupting normal rest and oxygen flow.
        </p>
		
        <h2 class="section__description">How Common Is It?</h2>
        <p>
          More than five million Canadian adults are estimated to have sleep apnea or be at high risk of developing it. It is more common among men, people over age 40, and those who are overweight, but it can affect anyone, at any age.
        </p>
		
        <h2 class="section__description">How Does It Affect Daily Life?</h2>
        <p>
          Untreated sleep apnea can cause daytime fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, and reduced quality of life. Effective treatment often improves energy levels, mood, and overall health.
        </p>
		
        <h2 class="section__description">Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Loud or frequent snoring</li>
			<li>Pauses in breathing during sleep (often noticed by a partner)</li>
			<li>Daytime sleepiness or fatigue</li>
			<li>Morning headaches</li>
			<li>Irritability, forgetfulness, or mood changes</li>
			<li>Decreased libido or poor concentration</li>
			</li>
        </ul>
		
        <h2 class="section__description">Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>There are two main types of sleep apnea:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</strong>: The most common form, caused by a blocked or narrowed airway during sleep. The blockage may involve the tongue, tonsils, or relaxed throat muscles.</li>
			<li><strong>Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)</strong>: Less common; occurs when the brain temporarily fails to send signals to the breathing muscles.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Risk factors include excess weight, family history, smoking, alcohol use, and certain medical conditions.</p>
        <h2 class="section__description">Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
        <p>
          Diagnosis requires a sleep study, conducted either in a sleep clinic or at home using specialized monitoring equipment. A healthcare professional interprets the results to determine the type and severity of apnea and recommend treatment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section__description">Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>Many people manage sleep apnea successfully with lifestyle changes, medical devices, or in rare cases, surgery.</p>
		<p>Helpful steps may include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoiding alcohol and sedative medications</li>
			<li>Quitting smoking</li>
			<li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>
			<li>Sleeping on your side instead of your back</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The most common treatment is <strong>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)</strong> therapy, which keeps the airway open by gently pressurizing inhaled air through a mask. Other treatments include dental devices or, in select cases, surgical procedures.</p>
		
        <h2 class="section__description">Complications</h2>
        <p>
          Without treatment, sleep apnea increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and accidents due to drowsiness. Consistent therapy can greatly reduce these risks.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section__description">Questions to Ask Your Healthcare Provider</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Do I need a sleep study?</li>
			<li>What are the health risks of untreated sleep apnea?</li>
			<li>What lifestyle changes could improve my condition?</li>
			<li>Is CPAP therapy right for me?</li>
			<li>How can I make CPAP more comfortable for nightly use?</li>
		</ul>
